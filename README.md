# RWA Airdrop

A decentralized platform for Real World Asset (RWA) token airdrops with zero-knowledge proof verification.

## Overview

This project enables secure and privacy-preserving distribution of RWA tokens through a combination of zero-knowledge proofs, smart contracts, and a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of three main components:

- [`/backend`](./backend/README.md) - Server-side implementation for handling user data and proof verification
- [`/frontend`](./frontend/README.md) - Web interface for users to participate in airdrops
- [`/zkp`](./zkp/README.md) - Zero-knowledge proof circuits and verification logic

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository:
- git clone https://github.com/MeowkGlobal/RWA-airdrop


2. Follow the setup instructions in each component's README:
- [Backend Setup](./backend/README.md#setup)
- [Frontend Setup](./frontend/README.md#setup)
- [ZKP Setup](./zkp/README.md#setup)
